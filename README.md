# TrainTheBot

Interactive game teaching students how AI learns from data. Made for The Coding School.

## Scenarios

1. **Cats vs Dogs** - Train an image classifier, learn how missing data causes errors
2. **Fruits vs Vegetables** - See how similar items confuse AI when it relies on simple patterns
3. **Guess the Training Data** - Observe AI outputs and deduce what it was trained on

## Key Lessons

- AI only learns from its training data
- Biased/incomplete data = biased/incorrect predictions
- You can spot AI bias by observing patterns in outputs

## Tech

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Tailwind CSS via CDN
- localStorage for progress tracking

## Run

Open `index.html` in a browser.
